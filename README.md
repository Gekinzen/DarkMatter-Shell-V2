# 📖 Overview

**Zenith Hybrid Alpha V2** is a modern, optimized rewrite that merges:

- QuickShell (with heavy customization)
- Hyprland intelligent rules engine
- DarkMatterShell (AvengeMedia)
- DankMaterial shell behaviors
- Zenith Hyprland Alpha V1 (my original approach)
- Multi-monitor dynamic logic carried over from V1

Goal:

> **A clean, stable, stylish, dynamic Wayland desktop with zero duplication, smart framework logic, and optimized performance.**
